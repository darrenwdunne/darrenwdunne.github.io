# dwdunne-website-build-with-gulp

Web site initialized with Yeoman to get the environment established. Real-time builds are via Gulp to concat, uglify, etc... to improve runtime performance, and Sass is used to auto-generate the CSS.  

I found Gulp to be much nicer than Grunt, and the Yeoman environment automatically setup the best-of-breed file structure and build environment.


## to build, simply:

```
git clone ...
npm install
bower install
gulp && gulp serve
```
